# IC22_Time
##Write a Java console program that allows a user to enter a time, which your code will validate and then indicate whether or not the time is valid.  The time will be in the format hour:minute followed by "am" or "pm".  

Create three exception classes (InvalidHourException, InvalidMinuteException and InvalidMeridiemException) that will indicate a specific type of error in the time entered by the user.  For example, InvalidHourException could be used to indicate that the value entered for hour was not an integer in the range 1 to 12.

Use a catch block for each different kind of exception.
